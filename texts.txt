The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore. The early bird
catches the worm. A stitch in time saves nine.
All that glitters is not gold. Actions speak louder
than words. The pen is mightier than the sword.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Curiosity killed
the cat. The grass is always greener on the other side.



Life is what you make it. Time flies when you're
having fun. Laughter is the best medicine. Honesty
is the best policy. The early bird catches the worm.
A picture is worth a thousand words. You can't judge
a book by its cover. The pen is mightier than
the sword. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. The
journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.



The world is your oyster. Don't judge a book by
its cover. Carpe diem - seize the day. The pen is
mightier than the sword. All that glitters is not gold.
Curiosity killed the cat. The early bird catches
the worm. Actions speak louder than words.
Laughter is the best medicine. The grass is always
greener on the other side.



A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Don't
cry over spilled milk. Rome wasn't built in a day.
Honesty is the best policy. Practice makes perfect.
Better late than never. Beggars can't be choosers.
A stitch in time saves nine. Birds of a feather flock
together. Haste makes waste. When in Rome, do as
the Romans do. Necessity is the mother of invention.



Life is a journey, not a destination. Beauty lies in
the eye of the beholder. Time is money. Knowledge
is power. Love is blind. Silence is golden. Patience
is a virtue. Truth will set you free. Nature takes care
of its own. Hope dies last. Love is the answer. Zito i
eleftheria! Happiness comes from within. Carpe diem
seize the day. All good things must come to an end.
